# Next Steps
 * Enable custom fonts
 * During deploy, wait until instance_profile_exists: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/IAM/Client.html#wait_until-instance_method
 * Load a backup (and respect version) if present on deployment
 * Use Devise Lockable to block brute-force password attempts
 * Make custom CSS file come AFTER the system CSS file (if possible?)

## Bugs
 * During upload of an image, the text field is still available for editing

## Deployment
 * script to update deployed blog to latest/specific version
   * including update of version blob
 * Figure out why it doesn't work with t3.nano
 * Experiment with initialized AMI
   * wait for instance_profile_exists??

## App
 * Permanent sessions, with idle timeout
 * Change images to -img- tags, with width and height for placeholders
 * Try dual local storage + S3, see if content laods faster
 * Model validations!!
 * Export functionality

## Reader
 * https://selfoss.aditu.de/ - FOSS, self-hosted
   * Try it out, add deployment
 * https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire - FOSS, mac/ios, local.  No support for private feeds (yet?)

# Tech Debt
 * upload image link throws error if no file selected
 * Import issues
   * import fails unless directories have trailing slash ("/")
   * failed import doesn't display an error
   * successful import doesn't display success on completion
 * Move user creation logic into model and reuse it between controller and create_user script
 * Post form has two buttons, and I have logic based on their value.  Move the value of the special button to a variable/constant so I can't break the logic by renaming the text
 * Add validation to post form
 * Add validation to settings form
